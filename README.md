# RSVtiming
This repository contains the code and data required to perform the analysis for the manuscript https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.21256632

We evaluated the timing of respiratory syncytial virus epidemics in 2021 using Google search data. Despite the unusual out-of-season timing, the relative timing of RSV epidemics between states in 2021 shared a similar spatial pattern with typical RSV
seasons. These insights can inform prophylaxis administration and planning of clinical trials.
